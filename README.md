## About The Project

Tired of seeing your minecraft server players mine and mine without any gain? An incentive ?
Download this plugin to your server and start rewarding players with (fake) bitcoins.


Everything is configurable, and choose where you want to save MySQL or in SQLite.

Includes:
* 🛒 Black markets
* 🚀 Booster multipliers
* ⛏️ Different earnings based on player pickaxe.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
